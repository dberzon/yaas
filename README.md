Yet another ableton script

Compatible with Ableton Live 9

So, although there are many ableton script, I had my problems with them so I decided to create a new one.
Probably you will have problems with mine too :)

What I try to create:
- Easily configurable script
- Functionality at least MackieControl
- Additionally function needed for live performing/jamming like looping
- Inclusion of other scripts would be very nice, i.e. ClyphX
- Easy to extend, just add a class and use it in configuration

I would love to write things down in a blog or wiki, so that others like me have a faster start. I tend to concentrate to much on technical things than making music, but the target of this hole thing is to make jamming easier for me.

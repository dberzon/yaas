Yet another ableton script

Compatible with Ableton Live 9

So, although there are many ableton script, I had my problems with them so I decided to create a new one.
Probably you will have problems with mine too :)

What I try to create:
- Easily configurable script
- Functionality at least MackieControl
- Additionally function needed for live performing/jamming like looping
- Inclusion of other scripts would be very nice, i.e. ClyphX
- Easy to extend, just add a class and use it in configuration

I would love to write things down in a blog or wiki, so that others like me have a faster start. I tend to concentrate to much on technical things than making music, but the target of this hole thing is to make jamming easier for me.

What it can do at the moment:
- configure keys and mappings in consts.py#
- select a Hash_Device, that means one of the devices in the set which has a name starting with '#'
  with a pedal or knob you can now change the first two device parameters 
- switch between chains on the device with midi keys
- define a max value for device controllers in the set (so you can adapt the mix to your surrounding, eg if you have an instrument loud enough to be heard already you can allow the full value. but if you can't hear your instrument you want to allow only a lower value so that you have a nice mix. 
  afterwards you can press your pedal or turn your nob to the maximum and get the perfect mix without thinking about it
